# Code of Conduct {{ site.name }}

Buckeye Cocoa is dedicated to providing an outstanding user group experience for all our attendees and members, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, financial status, hair color (or hair amount), platform preference, or text editor of choice.

We do not tolerate harassment of meeting participants in any form. Please treat your fellow people with respect, regardless of the context you’re interacting with each other.

Harassment is not appropriate for any venue. Group participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from any activities, without a refund, at the discretion of the group organizers.

Attendees must remember that Buckeye Cocoa staff members are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement. Buckeye Cocoa staff will immediately escalate issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to on-site staff or law enforcement.

For the protection of both attendees and our organization, Buckeye Cocoa will never put its organizers/volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits escalation. If there is any doubt, we will escalate incidents to the appropriate agency immediately.

Incident Resolution

Attendees should follow Bill and Ted’s advice: “Be excellent to each other.” Treat other attendees with respect, regardless of whether you are in a meeting or social event.

Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals concerned.
Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a Buckeye Cocoa organizing member. That staff member will immediately contact other Buckeye Cocoa organizing members who have the responsibility to assist in resolution.

Attendees suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact the on-site staff immediately, or a Buckeye Cocoa organizing member if they’re nearby. Buckeye Cocoa organizers will immediately escalate to law enforcement as appropriate.

This document is based on the [CodeMash Code of Conduct](http://www.codemash.org/codemash-code-conduct/) and unofficially used as a template for our Conduct document.
