As a reminder (or maybe this is new to you) we have our own Slack Team for communication:

* \#General
  * for Development talk
* \#Jobs
  * Hiring? Heard of a new job? Post it
* \#Random
  * For everything else

The [Buckeye Cocoa Slack Team](https://buckeyecocoa.slack.com/) is by invite-only. If you would like to join [contact us](/contact/).
